# TemperatureConverterSwing
It's a simple desktop app I made with Java and Swing that lets you switch temps between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It was good practice for stuff like using data types, designing a simple user interface, making sure the numbers people put in make sense, and keeping the code organized.

## 🚀 Features

- Converts temperatures between:
  - Celsius → Fahrenheit
  - Fahrenheit → Celsius
  - Celsius → Kelvin
  - Kelvin → Celsius
  - Fahrenheit → Kelvin
  - Kelvin → Fahrenheit
- Friendly Swing GUI interface
- Enhanced `switch` expressions for clean logic (for more details, consult here: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/language/switch-expressions.html)
- Error messages for invalid inputs
- Modular architecture with a utility class for formulas

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- JDK 14 or newer (for enhanced switch support)
- Java-compatible IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans
- Basic Swing familiarity
